9/11 Meeting

Dr. Vakanski & Molly primarily - Xian Gao came in later

Overview of the project/problem:
Pations go to physical therapist, and then are assigned exercises to do at home. they usually give up without tailored
feedback. Hiring a PT is inefficient and expensive. Following excersises on paper is ineficient and inaccurate

We must collect video data (including good movements and bad movements), then process the movements (using other 
models that we may have to fine-tune), build a model that outputs score and text, and IF ABLE, (NOT REQUIRED), make an
app that will use smart phone video to easily film and provide the models feedback

--------------------------------------------------------
My Questions and answers:

Which rehabilitation excercises should we have models for? How many?
 - Start with Squat, then add more when that works sufficiently

Will we have a different model for each exercise?
 - No. This question was not asked explicitly, but the model should recognize what exercise
   is being performed and provide feedback in the form of text

What outputs will the model generate? Quality Score vs. "Identify incorrect movement elements"?
 - Now i know that the model will be generating text as a response to the input -
   the text will say what in particular was wrong
 - E.g. Squats - don't let the heels come up, don't round back, go lower etc.

Can we use pre-built models?
 - YES
 - I found https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-opencv-pose-estimation/ and https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/master
   - Dr. Vakanski did not speak about these specifically
 - He mentioned some papers that combine LLM with movement data, and sent links to them
  - MotionGPT?
 - We still may need to find skeletal joint extraction libraries

Budgeting - Access to a GPU campus server is free. This project will have no expenses and no budget

We can meet with Dr. Vakanski regularly if we want to, or whenever we have questions

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO 

Read the papers that Dr. Vakanski has sent us
 - I uploaded these papers to this github for easy access
These papers reference existing models. Test them out, see what outputs they can produce
Schedule a team meeting to discuss a rough outline of project and short term goals
