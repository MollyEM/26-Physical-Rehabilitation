9/11 Meeting

Dr. Vakanski & Molly primarily - Xian Gao came in later

Overview of the project/problem:
Pations go to physical therapist, and then are assigned exercises to do at home. they usually give up without tailored
feedback. Hiring a PT is inefficient and expensive. Following excersises on paper is ineficient and inaccurate

We must collect video data (including good movements and bad movements), then process the movements (using other 
models that we may have to fine-tune), build a model that outputs score and text, and IF ABLE, (NOT REQUIRED), make an
app that will use smart phone video to easily film and provide the models feedback

--------------------------------------------------------
My Questions and answers:

Which rehabilitation excercises should we have models for? How many?
 - Start with Squat, then add more when that works sufficiently

Will we have a different model for each exercise?
 - No. This question was not asked explicitly, but the model should recognize what exercise
   is being performed and provide feedback in the form of text

What outputs will the model generate? Quality Score vs. "Identify incorrect movement elements"?
 - Now i know that the model will be generating text as a response to the input -
   the text will say what in particular was wrong
 - E.g. Squats - don't let the heels come up, don't round back, go lower etc.

Can we use pre-built models?
 - YES
 - I found https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-opencv-pose-estimation/ and https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/master
   - Dr. Vakanski did not speak about these specifically
 - He mentioned some papers that combine LLM with movement data, and sent links to them
  - MotionGPT?
 - We still may need to find skeletal joint extraction libraries

Budgeting - Access to a GPU campus server is free. This project will have no expenses and no budget

We can meet with Dr. Vakanski regularly if we want to, or whenever we have questions

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO 

Read the papers that Dr. Vakanski has sent us
 - I uploaded these papers to this github for easy access
These papers reference existing models. Test them out, see what outputs they can produce
Schedule a team meeting to discuss a rough outline of project and short term goals

Project Management

Initiation -> Planning and design -> Execution -> testing/monitor/control -> Closing
                     ^---------------------------------------v

Project management tools:
Team contract, timeline, mission statements, project status reports, action item list (every week), meetings
Gantt chart - put dates like snapshot on the calendar/to do list
Leave room for error
Check out schedule templates on uidaho mindworks

Budget - This does not apply to us
Shop resources - Also does not apply to us


======================================
9/14 Lecture notes

Project managers are hated because they have to nag the other engineers.
There are free project management softwares - Project Libre
 - However, its probably easier to just set up some excel tables to keep track of management

Basic steps in project managment:
 1. Define project: Ddeliverables, specifications, completion criteria
 2. generate tasks: > Deliverables, Milestones
                  > Work Breakdown structure 
 3. determine roles responsibilities: Who owns what, subject matter experts, by dicipline etc
 4. determine task sequence/critical path: Predecessor tasks, parallel tasks, estimate duration of tasks
 5. develop schedule: start at end date and work backwards
                  > early start dates, latest start dates, and early/ late end dates
                  > Save ALL slack time for April
 6. determine resource availabilty: Balance workloads and responsibilies according to availability of resources
 7. stablish budget: after everything is mapped out, then we can add costs up
 8. analyze risks and contigency plans: likely things that would prevent the project from succeeding -> prevention, mitigation 
 9. track and manage project: weekly updates, track effort/timeline, shift resources if necessary
 10. post project review: Good bad and ugly
