Using Deep Learning to Provide Feedback for Remote Physical Rehabilitation 

Team Name: Remote Rehabilitation

Purpose:
When patients incorrectly perform physical therapy exercises their doctor suggests following an injury, their recovery time is extended, leading to financial and physical strain. By adjusting a deep learning model that analyzes videos of clients exercising remotely, we can provide real time feedback potentially resulting in improved rehabilitation outcomes.
