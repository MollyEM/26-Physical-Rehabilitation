I modeled my code off of code in this blog post:
  https://spyjetson.blogspot.com/2021/03/running-openpose-models-directly-from.html

V1.ipynb places red dots at estimated joint locations of a photo of any size.

There are photo scale issues. 
  In the section of code that looks like this:
    .append(CONST*point[0], CONST*point[1])
  you will need to adjust the CONST value so that the points line up with the photo
  I have not yet figured out how to find the correct scale factor except by guess and check

  I also don't understand what some of the parameters are for image 'blobification'
      i think these might have something to do with the above issue

Other issues:
    I cannot halt the kernel after running this script. I can only restart it. Very annoying
      Maybe just with my machine??? someone verify please.
